# 48 students visited animals on a zoo field trip
# 10 students got sick with the plague
# Some students visited one or more animals for an "up close" visit that involved touching (see table)
# Calculate the relative risk for being a case for each animal visited compared to those visiting no animals
# Based on this calculation, what is the most likely exposure?

# PERFORM CALCULATIONS ---------------------------------------------------------

# determine the attack rate in cases that visited animal exhibits
attack_rate_exhibit <- df$Cases / df$Total
attack_rate_exhibit <- round(attack_rate_exhibit, 2)

# determine the reference attack rate in cases that did not visit any animal exhibits

# calculate the relative risk

# SOLUTION ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# which exhibit has the highest relative risk?
