# Fighting COVID-19 with Epidemiology: A Johns Hopkins Teach-Out

## Motivation

In light of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, I have decided to follow this amazing free course offered by the altruistic brainiacs at Johns Hopkins:

https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid19-epidemiology

I have created this repo to share code that I write to help myself understand what is going on in the course. I hope it is helpful to someone out there.

## Running the Code

### What is the R programming language?

R is a language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics. It is incredibly flexible, fun and easy to learn. For more information on R, see here:

### RStudio IDE

To run the code in this repository you will need an environment in which to run R code. I strongly recommend RStudio, but you are free to poke around and use whichever R environment suits your personal preferences.
